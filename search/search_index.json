The project at the beginning had different name and was a collection of simple python scripts. It was a playground for me to learning python, trading algorithms and strategies. Over time the application grew into a CLI application. I found a CLI not so user-friendly, oriented only for an advanced user, and it didn't support my vision. At the moment FTT application is written using QT and PySide6 framework.</p> <p>The main objective of FTT is to provide a set of tools to help calculate and optimize a portfolio that is easy and intuitive to use.</p> <p>The future of the application is to be a tool that operates a collection of securities, and suggests financial operations such as hold, buy, sell, and optimize portfolio. Once mature, the application will autonomously perform financial operations on the live market via integration with a broker system.</p>"},{"location":"#vision","title":"Vision","text":"<p>Finance is hard.

This solution creates a portfolio out of suggested securities, calculates weights using different algorithms, and provides multiple portfolio candidates. In addition, the solution improves portfolios by adding additional securities to make each portfolio candidate balanced.</li> <li>It is hard for a non-technical person to decide what portfolio will be the best and choose among multiple options because algorithms are complicated, and the logic behind them is complex to understand. The solution helps investors decide by running backtest with each generated portfolio candidate over the indicated historical period and provides results. The result is the best-performed portfolios categorized by risk, volatility, and dividends.</li> <li>The Investor chooses a portfolio out of the resulting list. The next step is to allocate calculated weights to the budget and buy securities. The solution is not a securities brokerage system but can easily communicate. The Investor initiates a securities purchase operation, and the solution communicates with a connected brokerage system and initiates securities purchase operations. The brokerage system completes operations and communicates back to the solution. The solution displays information to the Investor.</li> <li>Purchase of securities is the first step to achieving the best result. The Investor must follow market updates, set stop-loss operations on each security in the portfolio, and rebalance the portfolio occasionally. The solution monitors the latest security trends in the active portfolio and automatically prevents losses by automatically initiating selling and buying operations. The solution prompts rebalancing on time when it is reasonable. The Investor and user of the solution receive immediate notifications and observe the portfolio's performance in an easily digestible way.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#current-reality","title":"Current reality","text":"<p>There are a few options that a regular investor has.</p>"},{"location":"#option-1","title":"Option 1","text":"<p>An investor chooses a simple self-driving solution by choosing acceptable risks and scheduled or occasional financial investments.
